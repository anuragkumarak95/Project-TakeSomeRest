#Project - TakeSomeREST

###Description:

Project-TakeSomeREST is an Android Application base project to accomplish the task of performing as a efficient RESTfull HTTP Client. Normally any developer can perform GET and POST Client methods over any browser but REST also provides many other methods including PUT, DELETE, OPTION, etc. Our main aim is to create an independent client that can perform such action.

There are already many HTTP REST Clients in the market but not many of them have ventured the Android environment with quite the enthusiasm.

####Our concern in this project:

  1. Being User Friendly :  Creating the most efficient and interactive environment for the client users.
  2. Keeping Power to the users : Facilitating the user with all possible tweaking provided by the RESTfull service rather than hardcoding them to the application.
  3. Keeping Things Simple : Try to implement all possibilities in single Activity or window and still simplifying the content. trying not to overwhelm the users with available possibilities.
  4. Being A STUD : most efficient and performance friendly transactional animations for all independent actions to interact with user more life-like. this includes the UI and UX improvisation in standard or may be out-of-the-box manner.

####Progress so far:
##### 24-01-2016 @anuragkumarak95 : Research over what is needed to be done.
  * Understanding the standard RESTfull capabilities and resourcing the project with all possible implementations.
